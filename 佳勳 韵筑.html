                <h3 class="book-author-name">Mary Shelley</h3>
                <p class="book-author-dates">August 30, 1797 – February 1, 1851</p>
                <p class="book-author-bio">Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley was an English novelist best known for her Gothic novel Frankenstein, widely considered one of the first works of science fiction. Born in London, she was the daughter of political philosopher William Godwin and feminist writer Mary Wollstonecraft. Tragically, her mother died shortly after her birth. At age 16, she began a relationship with the Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, whom she later married. The idea for Frankenstein came to her during the famous summer of 1816 at Lake Geneva, when she, Percy Shelley, Lord Byron, and others challenged each other to write ghost stories. She was only 18 when she began writing Frankenstein, which was published anonymously in 1818. The novel explores themes of scientific ethics, creation and responsibility, and the nature of humanity itself. Shelley's work was groundbreaking not only for its innovative genre-blending but also for its complex moral and philosophical questions that remain relevant today. Beyond Frankenstein, she wrote several other novels and worked to preserve and promote her late husband's poetry after her death in 1822.</p>

                    <p class="book-author">by Kiera Cass</p>
                    <p class="book-description">This is a novel with class and court as the background. It describes the story of America from the fifth class who was selected as a candidate for the princess because of her family's needs. She had to stand out among the thirty-five princess candidates. But because of America's sincerity, she won the admiration of the prince. So she was finally selected as the final six competitors.</p>
                    <div class="book-quote">After I watched The Hunger Games, I found that their story structures are very similar.</div>
                    <p class="book-reflection">The court competition is like a reality show of survival. Every woman wants to win the favor of the prince. And the power of the whole country is in the hands of the royal family. When I am a reader, I realize how bad this system is. But when it really happens, we don't realize that we are also a contestant. I highly recommend everyone to read this book.</p>

I think when you feel confused about life, you might as well open this book, it will give you inspiration.</p>

                    <p class="book-description">Set in a dystopian world, the Hunger Games is an annual survival competition to control the population. A story about rebellion and awakening.</p>
                    <div class="book-quote">Awakening is a very important concept in this story.</div>
                    <p class="book-reflection">In our daily lives, we are often brainwashed by too much information. We don't have time to think about the correctness of every piece of information. But when we start to think, we can stop being dominated by others. When we can listen to our voice, we will not become a piece on someone else's chessboard. When you know what you are doing, others cannot control you.</p>

                    <p class="book-description">Coraline has always lacked the company of adults. Coraline finds it is hard to understand adult's behaviors. Coraline is just like any other child, she desires the care and affection from her parents. She hopes that everyone can value herself instead of treating her perfunctorily. Because no one cared about her or guided her, Coraline always went on adventures alone.</p>

                    <p class="book-reflection">When children lack real company, they always look for external things. If adults can put themselves in the children's shoes, communicating with children from a child's perspective will be better for both sides. I think there is nothing wrong with children being curious. Everyone was once a child, and children should be allowed to explore the world.</p>
